Reading: Learning Processing

## Learning Processing

Don't worry about the next great book. Processing is good. Also this book is about learning programming and not about this language or that. You can apply what you learn here anywhere. So its ok. Just read it.

- Practice everyday. There is no other way to learn this stuff.
- one-step-at-a-time
